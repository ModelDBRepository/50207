Kinetic NMDA receptor model
---------------------------

Based on voltage-clamp recordings of NMDA receptor-mediated currents in 
nucleated patches of  rat neocortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons (Kampa 2004),
this model was fit with AxoGraph directly to experimental recordings in order
to obtain the optimal values for the parameters.

data in figure 2 in Kampa et al (2004) J Physiol.
------------------------------------------------------

The NMDA receptor model uses realistic rates of magnesium block and its effects 
on channel desensitisation. Presynaptic transmitter release is necessary for 
glutamate binding to the receptor.
